            <h3 id="headline">The following is Raila Odinga life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1945</strong> - Kisumu District, Nyanza Province on 7 January 1945</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1969</strong> -Of Luo descent, Odinga was the son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga,
                    the first vice president of independent Kenya.
                    After earning a master’s degree in mechanical engineering in East Germany
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1970</strong> - Odinga returned to Kenya to become a lecturer at the University
                    of Nairobi. During his time at the university, Odinga also engaged in engineering-related
                    business ventures,
                    including one that would later become East African Spectre, Ltd.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1974</strong> -He left the university and was soon
                    employed by the Kenya Bureau of Standards,
                    where he attained the position of deputy director in
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1982</strong> - he was accused of plotting against Pres.
                    Daniel arap Moi and was imprisoned without trial for six years. After Odinga’s release,
                    he was twice arrested for campaigning against one-party rule,
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1992</strong> - he sought refuge in Norway. He returned to Kenya
                    however, and was elected a member of the National Assembly that year under
                    the banner of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy–Kenya (FORD–K),
                    the party led by his father.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1994</strong> - Odinga became embroiled in a leadership struggle within
                    the party and in 1996 left FORD–K and joined the National Development Party (NDP).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1997</strong> -Odinga stood unsuccessfully as the NDP’s candidate for election
                    as president of Kenya but was able to retain his seat in the National Assembly. He and
                    the NDP thereafter gave their support to Moi and the ruling Kikuyu-dominated Kenya African
                    National Union (KANU). Odinga joined Moi’s cabinet as energy minister in 2001, and the NDP
                    was absorbed into the ruling party the following year, with Odinga becoming secretary-general of
                    KANU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2002</strong> -Odinga stood unsuccessfully as the NDP’s candidate for election as president
                    of Kenya
                    but was able to retain his seat in the National Assembly. He and the NDP thereafter gave their
                    support to Moi
                    and the ruling Kikuyu-dominated Kenya African National Union (KANU). Odinga joined Moi’s cabinet as
                    energy minister
                    in 2001, and the NDP was absorbed into the ruling party the following year, with Odinga becoming
                    secretary-general of KANU.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2003</strong> - As one of the NARC leaders, Odinga had played a significant role in securing
                    the election of Kibaki,
                    campaigning relentlessly on his behalf after the presidential candidate was seriously injured in a
                    car accident in the month
                    leading up to the polls. After his election, Kibaki appointed Odinga as minister of roads, public
                    works, and housing, but the
                    LDP soon accused Kibaki of reneging on the preelection agreement between the LDP and NAK that
                    promised to share cabinet posts
                    and power more equitably between the two parties. Tensions between the two NARC factions further
                    increased over several issues
                    discussed at the country’s constitutional review conference in the spring of
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2005</strong> -It was not approved, however, as Odinga successfully led a campaign against
                    it. Soon after, Kibaki dismissed
                    his entire cabinet and reconstituted it the next month, without Odinga or many of the former cabinet
                    members who supported Odinga.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> - In the months prior to the 2007 presidential and legislative elections,
                    Kibaki formed his own coalition,
                    the Party of National Unity (PNU). During the campaign, Odinga sought to dispel the perceived
                    grievances of some western Kenyan
                    ethnic groups by denouncing corruption in high places and by campaigning for a fairer distribution
                    of land and the devolvement of
                    power to largely single-ethnic district councils.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2008</strong> - former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and Jakaya Kikwete, president of
                    Tanzania and chairman of the African
                    Union, brokered an agreement between Kibaki and Odinga for the PNU and the ODM to form a coalition
                    government. This led to Odinga’s being
                    sworn in on April 17, 2008, to the newly created post of prime minister under Kibaki’s presidency
                    and with a power-sharing cabinet. Tensions
                    within the new government soon appeared, however, and Odinga had only limited success with
                    implementing his reform-oriented agenda.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2009</strong> - Odinga complained that ODM cabinet ministers were not being included in
                    decision-making discussions, and that led
                    him to boycott cabinet meetings for a time. Another row erupted in early
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>2010</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
                    supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
                    we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
                    are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
                    plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
                    people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong> - Odinga remained politically active. In the prelude to the 2017 elections,
                    Odinga’s ODM party and the other parties that
                    were previously part of the CORD coalition allied with more parties to form the National Super
                    Alliance (NASA). The new alliance backed Odinga
                    for president and Musyoka for deputy president to stand in the upcoming elections. The run-up to the
                    elections was tense and filled with heated
                    rhetoric, particularly from NASA and Pres. Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party. NASA made repeated claims that
                    the Jubilee-led government would try to rig the elections.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>The Fifth president of Kenya 2022</strong> -Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta endorsed his former rival for the country's top
                job. "We have chosen Raila Odinga ," he told a
                cheering crowd in Nairobi.The move comes 2 weeks after their parties joined forces ahead of presidential
                and parliamentary elections in August. Under
                the banner Azimio la Umoja meaning Quest for unity , Mr Kenyatta’s Jubilee Party and Odigan’s Orange
                Democratic Movement united with other politicals groups. </li>
